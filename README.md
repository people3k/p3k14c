## Contents

The [:file\_folder: vignettes/articles](vignettes/articles) directory contains:

  - [:page\_facing\_up: p3k14c](vignettes/articles/p3k14c.Rmd): R
    Markdown source document for the manuscript. Includes code to
    reproduce the figures and tables generated by the analysis. It also
    has a rendered version, `p3k14c.html`, suitable for reading
    (the code is replaced by figures and tables in this file).
  - [:file\_folder: figures](vignettes/articles/figures): Plots and other
    illustrations
  - [:file\_folder: tables](vignettes/articles/tables): Tables included in 
    the paper

## How to run in your browser or download and run locally

The simplest way to explore the text, code and data is to click on
[binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/people3k/p3k14c/master?urlpath=rstudio)
to open an instance of RStudio in your browser, which will have the
compendium files ready to work with. Binder uses
(rocker-project.org)\[rocker-project.org Docker\] images to ensure a
consistent and reproducible computational environment. These Docker
images can also be used locally.

You can download the compendium as a zip from from this URL:
[main.zip](/archive/main.zip). After unzipping, open the `Proj` file
in RStudio, and run `devtools::install()` to ensure you have the
packages this analysis depends on (also listed in the
[DESCRIPTION](/DESCRIPTION) file). Then open `p3k14c.Rmd` and knit
to produce the paper in PDF format.

## Installation

You can install the released version of p3k14c from Github with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("people3k/p3k14c@0.9.1")
```

## Executable research compendium
You are required to have a copy of the raw **p3k14c** dataset, available through tDAR at [https://doi.org/10.48512/XCV8459173](https://doi.org/10.48512/XCV8459173). Clone this repository, then place the `p3k14c_raw.csv` at `../p3k14c-data/p3k14c_raw.csv`, relative to the working director of the cloned repository.

You can do so thus:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/people3k/p3k14c
cd p3k14c
```

You can compile the research compendium through the terminal:

``` bash
R -e "rmarkdown::render('vignettes/articles/p3k14c.Rmd', output_dir = 'vignettes/articles')"
```

or, within R itself:
``` r
rmarkdown::render('vignettes/articles/p3k14c.Rmd', output_dir = 'vignettes/articles')
```

## Accessing the scrubbed/fuzzed **p3k14c** dataset
Once the **p3k14c** package is installed, you can access the scrubbed/fuzzed **p3k14c** via R:
``` r
library(p3k14c)
p3k14c::p3k14c_data
```
